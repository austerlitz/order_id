# OrderId

If you're tired of creating a _kinda_ unique ids based on a timestamp, look no further.
OrderId will create a hash-looking id strings that are nice and decodable back to a timestamp.
`3I7BX-6WERP-CD4` is much better than `1661113911.978755`.

Basically, it takes a current timestamp and translates it to a string of upper-cased characters split in groups 
of XX chars separated by a custom separator-char. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'OrderId'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install OrderId

## Usage

```ruby
OrderId.generate # G3RRY-ZMIHR-CCZ3P-FGXM
OrderId.get_time('G3RRY-ZMIHR-CCZ3P-FGXM') # 2022-08-21 20:33:18 +0000
```
### Parameters
OrderId takes four optional parameters:
- `length`: number of decimal places in a timestamps. Makes no sense if it's over 20, common sense is 10 or 12.
- `base`: base number system. Defaults to 36, but any arbitrary base is a good place to obfuscate your ids. E.g . `OrderId.generate(base: 12) # 12616-51312-6751B-A87B1-72235-444`
- `separator`: a separator char. Defaults to `-` but can be `'/'` or any non-digit and non-word character
- `group_length`: a number of chars in groups separated by a `separator`. Defaults to 4. `OrderId.generate(base: 12, length: 4, group_length: 8) # "1A434285-32526"`

### Restoring a timestamp from an Id
If you know the parameters which the Id has been generated with you can restore a timestamp the Id was based on.

```ruby
OrderId.get_time('1A434285-32526', base: 12, length: 4) # 2022-08-21 20:49:34 +0000
```
